"""
Question scoping node for the Focused Research Agent.

This module contains the node responsible for interpreting and scoping
the user's research question. It uses the LLM provider to produce a
focused scope string, a list of assumptions, and a constraints dict
that guide the rest of the research workflow.

If the LLM response is invalid or missing required keys, an error is
recorded in state and the graph routes to handle_error.
